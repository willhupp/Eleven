Fifteen Game

William Hupp

Objective: On a 4x4 board, with blocks 1-15, and an empty block, the user
 should attempt to put the blocks in numerical order with the empty block
at the end. This is accomplished by clicking on a block adjadent to the
empty block. This swaps the blocks. 

Interface:
New Game button starts the game over.
Quit button quits Fifteen.

The game is an application.

We implemented the new game and quit features. Changed the color
scheme and look and feel of the board. We also added a title to
the application and changed the font layout of buttons.

All work was done using pair programming.
